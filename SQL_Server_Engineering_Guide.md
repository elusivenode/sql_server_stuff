## T-SQL Essentials

### Core Concepts

- **Joins**:
  - `INNER JOIN`: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
  - `LEFT OUTER JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right. NULLs for unmatched.
  - `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`: Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left. NULLs for unmatched.
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Combines results of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.
  - `CROSS JOIN`: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.
  - `SELF JOIN`: A table is joined to itself using aliases.

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
  - Temporary result set defined with `WITH` keyword.
  - Useful for recursion, better readability, breaking down complex queries.
  - Example:
```sql
WITH SalesCTE AS (
    SELECT SalesPersonID,
           SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY SalesPersonID
)

SELECT *
FROM SalesCTE
WHERE TotalSales > 10000;
```

- **Subqueries**:
  - A query nested inside another query (`SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE`).
  - Correlated subqueries reference the outer query and are executed row-by-row.
  - Inline subqueries useful for calculated columns or filtering.
  - Example:
```sql
SELECT Name,  Salary FROM Employees e WHERE Salary > ( SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM
Employees WHERE DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID );
```

- **APPLY (CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY)**:
  - Enables joining each row to a table-valued function or derived table.
  - `CROSS APPLY` behaves like `INNER JOIN`.
  - `OUTER APPLY` behaves like `LEFT JOIN`.
  - Best used when:
    - Using table-valued functions
    - Joining on derived tables that depend on outer rows
  - Example:
```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID,  e.Name,  t.MostRecentTrainingDate FROM Employees e OUTER
APPLY ( SELECT TOP 1 TrainingDate AS MostRecentTrainingDate FROM Training t
WHERE t.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID ORDER BY TrainingDate DESC ) t;
```

### Comparison

| Feature            | CTE                    | Subquery                     | APPLY                              |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Readability        | High                   | Medium                        | Medium                              |
| Reusability        | Moderate (referencable) | Low                           | High (w/ table-valued functions)    |
| Recursion support  | Yes                    | No                            | No                                  |
| Performance        | Similar to derived tables | Inline fast, Correlated slower | Efficient with TVFs, sometimes better |

### Use Cases

- Use **CTEs** when:
  - Breaking a complex query into parts
  - Performing recursive operations (e.g., org charts)

- Use **Subqueries** when:
  - You need a quick filter or inline computation
  - The subquery is scalar or tightly bound to the main query

- Use **APPLY** when:
  - You need to invoke a table-valued function per row
  - Joining each row in the outer query to dynamic subsets

- **MERGE statements**:
  - Allows `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` in one operation by comparing target and source.
  - Example:
```sql
MERGE INTO TargetTable AS T USING SourceTable AS S ON T.ID = S.ID WHEN MATCHED
THEN UPDATE SET T.Value = S.Value WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET     THEN INSERT
(ID,  Value) VALUES (S.ID,  S.Value) WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE     THEN DELETE;
```
  - Use cases:
    - Synchronizing tables (ETL)
    - Handling slow-changing dimensions
    - Auditing via `OUTPUT` clause
  - When to use:
    - You want atomic sync logic
    - You need row-level audit logging
    - Logic isnâ€™t overly conditional

  - Performance Comparison:

    | Factor                  | MERGE                              | UPDATE + INSERT                  |
    |-------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
    | Simplicity              | One statement                      | Separate logic paths             |
    | Readability             | Complex if many conditions         | Easier for basic logic           |
    | Small Set Performance   | Comparable                         | Slightly faster sometimes        |
    | Large Set Performance   | May degrade with complexity        | Often more efficient             |
    | OUTPUT Support          | Supported                          | Limited to `INSERT`/`UPDATE`     |
    | Error Handling          | All-or-nothing                     | Finer control                    |
