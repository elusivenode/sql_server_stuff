## T-SQL Essentials

### Core Concepts

- **Joins**:
  - `INNER JOIN`: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
  - `LEFT OUTER JOIN`: Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right. NULLs for unmatched.
  - `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`: Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left. NULLs for unmatched.
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN`: Combines results of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.
  - `CROSS JOIN`: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.
  - `SELF JOIN`: A table is joined to itself using aliases.

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**:
  - Temporary result set defined with `WITH` keyword.
  - Useful for recursion, better readability, breaking down complex queries.
  - Example:
```sql
WITH SalesCTE AS (
    SELECT SalesPersonID,
           SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY SalesPersonID
)

SELECT *
FROM SalesCTE
WHERE TotalSales > 10000;
```

- **Subqueries**:
  - A query nested inside another query (`SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE`).
  - Correlated subqueries reference the outer query and are executed row-by-row.
  - Inline subqueries useful for calculated columns or filtering.
  - Example:
```sql
SELECT Name,  Salary FROM Employees e WHERE Salary > ( SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM
Employees WHERE DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID );
```

- **APPLY (CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY)**:
  - Enables joining each row to a table-valued function or derived table.
  - `CROSS APPLY` behaves like `INNER JOIN`.
  - `OUTER APPLY` behaves like `LEFT JOIN`.
  - Best used when:
    - Using table-valued functions
    - Joining on derived tables that depend on outer rows
  - Example:
```sql
SELECT e.EmployeeID,  e.Name,  t.MostRecentTrainingDate FROM Employees e OUTER
APPLY ( SELECT TOP 1 TrainingDate AS MostRecentTrainingDate FROM Training t
WHERE t.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID ORDER BY TrainingDate DESC ) t;
```

### Comparison

| Feature            | CTE                    | Subquery                     | APPLY                              |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Readability        | High                   | Medium                        | Medium                              |
| Reusability        | Moderate (referencable) | Low                           | High (w/ table-valued functions)    |
| Recursion support  | Yes                    | No                            | No                                  |
| Performance        | Similar to derived tables | Inline fast, Correlated slower | Efficient with TVFs, sometimes better |

### Use Cases

- Use **CTEs** when:
  - Breaking a complex query into parts
  - Performing recursive operations (e.g., org charts)

- Use **Subqueries** when:
  - You need a quick filter or inline computation
  - The subquery is scalar or tightly bound to the main query

- Use **APPLY** when:
  - You need to invoke a table-valued function per row
  - Joining each row in the outer query to dynamic subsets

- **MERGE statements**:
  - Allows `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` in one operation by comparing target and source.
  - Example:
```sql
MERGE INTO TargetTable AS T USING SourceTable AS S ON T.ID = S.ID WHEN MATCHED
THEN UPDATE SET T.Value = S.Value WHEN NOT MATCHED BY TARGET     THEN INSERT
(ID,  Value) VALUES (S.ID,  S.Value) WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE     THEN DELETE;
```
  - Use cases:
    - Synchronizing tables (ETL)
    - Handling slow-changing dimensions
    - Auditing via `OUTPUT` clause
  - When to use:
    - You want atomic sync logic
    - You need row-level audit logging
    - Logic isn’t overly conditional

  - Performance Comparison:

    | Factor                  | MERGE                              | UPDATE + INSERT                  |
    |-------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
    | Simplicity              | One statement                      | Separate logic paths             |
    | Readability             | Complex if many conditions         | Easier for basic logic           |
    | Small Set Performance   | Comparable                         | Slightly faster sometimes        |
    | Large Set Performance   | May degrade with complexity        | Often more efficient             |
    | OUTPUT Support          | Supported                          | Limited to `INSERT`/`UPDATE`     |
    | Error Handling          | All-or-nothing                     | Finer control                    |


## 🧠 Indexing & Performance Tuning

### 🔧 Core Concepts

**🔹 Clustered vs Non-Clustered Indexes**  
- A **clustered index** determines the **physical order** of rows in a table. Each table can have only one.  
  - Ideal for **range queries**, sorting, and grouping.  
  - Typically created on the **primary key**.  
- A **non-clustered index** is a separate structure that points to the actual data rows.  
  - Multiple non-clustered indexes can exist per table.  
  - Best for **point lookups**, **JOINs**, and selective filters.

**🔹 INCLUDE Columns & Filtered Indexes**  
- The `INCLUDE` clause allows you to add **non-key columns** to the leaf level of a non-clustered index.  
  - Useful for creating **covering indexes** that eliminate the need for key lookups.  
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX IX_Customer_Email ON Customers (LastName) INCLUDE (Email, Phone);
  ```
- **Filtered indexes** only index a **subset of rows**, improving performance and reducing index size.  
  - Especially effective for columns with sparse data (e.g. `IsActive = 1`).  
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX IX_Active_Customers ON Customers (CustomerID) WHERE IsActive = 1;
  ```

**🔹 Columnstore Indexes & Execution Plans**  
- **Columnstore indexes** store data by column rather than by row.  
  - Great for **analytics** on large datasets (e.g. fact tables).  
  - Compress well and support batch mode processing.  
  - Available as **clustered** or **non-clustered** columnstores.  
- **Execution plans** (estimated or actual) are essential for diagnosing query performance:  
  - Use to identify **scans vs seeks**, **missing indexes**, and expensive operators like **hash joins**.

**🔹 Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)**  
- Useful DMVs for performance analysis include:  
  - `sys.dm_exec_requests` — Shows currently executing queries.  
  - `sys.dm_exec_query_stats` — Aggregated performance stats (CPU time, I/O, executions).  
  - `sys.dm_db_missing_index_details` — Lists suggested indexes (review before implementing).  
  - `sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats` — Provides fragmentation data per index.

**🔹 Index Fragmentation & Statistics**  
- Indexes can become **fragmented**, especially after many DML operations:  
  - Use `REORGANIZE` if fragmentation is between 5–30%.  
  - Use `REBUILD` if fragmentation exceeds 30%.  
  ```sql
  ALTER INDEX IX_SalesDate ON Sales REBUILD;
  ```
- **Statistics** help the optimizer estimate row counts and choose efficient plans.  
  - Keep up to date via `AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS` or schedule manual updates.  
  ```sql
  UPDATE STATISTICS dbo.MyTable WITH FULLSCAN;
  ```

## Performance Monitoring

SQL Server offers a variety of built-in tools for performance monitoring. Modern best practices emphasize lightweight, low-overhead tools that can be used in production environments with minimal impact.

### Query Store

Query Store is a feature that captures a history of query execution plans, runtime statistics, and regressions over time.

**Key Benefits:**
- Identifies performance regressions automatically
- Retains historical performance data across server restarts
- Supports plan forcing to stabilize workloads

**Configuration Example:**
```sql
ALTER DATABASE [MyDatabase]
SET QUERY_STORE = ON;
ALTER DATABASE [MyDatabase]
SET QUERY_STORE (
    OPERATION_MODE = READ_WRITE,
    CLEANUP_POLICY = (STALE_QUERY_THRESHOLD_DAYS = 30)
);
```

**Useful Reports:**
- Top Resource Consuming Queries
- Regressed Queries
- Forced Plan Usage

**DMVs:**
- `sys.query_store_query`
- `sys.query_store_plan`
- `sys.query_store_runtime_stats`

> 📌 *Recommended for all OLTP databases from SQL Server 2016 onward.*

---

### Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)

DMVs expose live metadata and runtime statistics for diagnosing SQL Server performance.

**Commonly Used DMVs:**

| DMV | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `sys.dm_exec_requests` | Shows active requests, useful for real-time monitoring |
| `sys.dm_exec_query_stats` | Tracks aggregated query performance |
| `sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats` | Helps evaluate index usage and identify unused indexes |
| `sys.dm_os_wait_stats` | Analyzes wait types to identify bottlenecks |
| `sys.dm_db_missing_index_details` | Identifies potentially beneficial indexes |

**Example – Top 5 CPU-Consuming Queries:**
```sql
SELECT TOP 5
    qs.total_worker_time / qs.execution_count AS AvgCPU,
    qs.execution_count,
    qt.text
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) qt
ORDER BY AvgCPU DESC;
```

> 🧠 *Use DMVs in combination with historical baselines for trend analysis.*

---

### Extended Events (XEvents)

Extended Events provide a flexible and lightweight framework for capturing detailed event-level data with minimal performance impact.

**Use Cases:**
- Capturing deadlocks
- Analyzing query wait types
- Monitoring tempdb contention
- Tracking long-running queries

**Creating a Session (Deadlocks Example):**
```sql
CREATE EVENT SESSION [CaptureDeadlocks] ON SERVER
ADD EVENT sqlserver.deadlock_graph
ADD TARGET package0.ring_buffer
WITH (STARTUP_STATE = ON);
GO
ALTER EVENT SESSION [CaptureDeadlocks] ON SERVER STATE = START;
```

**Viewing Captured Events:**

Use the Extended Events GUI in SSMS under **Management > Extended Events > Sessions**, or query the ring buffer:

```sql
SELECT 
    event_data.value('(event/@name)[1]', 'varchar(50)') AS event_name,
    event_data.value('(event/data[@name="xml_report"]/value)[1]', 'xml') AS deadlock_graph
FROM (
    SELECT CAST(event_data AS XML) AS ev_
